# Organ-Donation-System-Using-Python
The Organ Donation System is a comprehensive software application designed to streamline 
the organ donation process. It enables donors to register themselves and hospitals to list patients 
in need of organs. The system facilitates the matching of donors with patients, simplifying the 
organ donation process.
This advanced software solution addresses the critical and continually expanding demand for 
efficient organ allocation and management within the healthcare sector. The system's 
development aims to streamline the organ donation process, enhance communication among 
stakeholders and most importantly, save lives by ensuring the timely transplantation of vital 
organs to patients in need.
